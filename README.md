# Diabetes Prediction

This code analyzes a diabetes dataset to build a model for predicting whether a person has diabetes based on various medical features. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

    Data Import and Exploration:
        Libraries: Imports necessary libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn for data manipulation, scaling, and machine learning.
        Dataset Loading: Reads the diabetes dataset (diabetes.csv) using Pandas.
        Data Preview: Prints the first few rows of the dataset to get a glimpse of the data.

    Data Preprocessing:
        Feature Selection: Creates separate matrices for features (X) and target variable (Y - "Outcome").
        Data Scaling: Standardizes the features using StandardScaler for better model performance.
        Class Distribution: Prints the number of instances for each class ("Outcome") to understand the imbalance (if any).

    Model Training and Evaluation:
        Train-Test Split: Splits the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets to avoid overfitting the model.
        Model Training: Trains a Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier on the training data.
        Accuracy Evaluation: Calculates and prints the accuracy of the model on both training and testing data.

    Predictions on New Data:
        Input Data: Defines a list of new data points with medical features for six individuals.
        Prediction: Uses the trained model to predict the "Outcome" (diabetes) for each new data point.
        Results: Prints the predicted class and the count of each predicted class for the new data.

Overall, this code demonstrates the process of building and evaluating a machine learning model for diabetes prediction using a Support Vector Machine. By analyzing a diabetes dataset, the model can learn to identify patterns in medical features and predict the likelihood of diabetes for new patients.
